## Interactive Visualization Dashboard of Glucose Data Using Python

This repository contains the code and elements for my project which aims to display an interactive dashboard of my blood glucose data. As a Type 1 Diabetic, I wear a continuous glucose monitor in order to help calculate my insulin dosage whenever I eat and through out the day. The target range for my blood glucose is anywhere between 4.0-8.0 mmol/L. While I monitor myself, my family and loved ones do not have access to this data. This portfolio project aims to share the data in a simple and consumable form (interactive dashboard report) with my family.

This repository now contains the 1st version of the interactive dashboard, now deployed to the web! It includes a plot of my blood glucose through out the day, as well as an interactive table of values (blood glucose), and lastly a bar plot which shows the amount of time I'm within target, below target, or above target. 

Interactivity includes picking which dates to display or measure from, as well as navigating the graphs. I've added a red region in my plots to indicate critical 'low' areas, where it is possible to feel the effects of low blood sugar (consequences range from shivering, fainting, etc.). Additionally, the green region on the plot indicates the target interval for my blood glucose.

Now that I've successfully (painfully I should say) deployed my dashboard to the web, my next step includes looking into the automation of the collection of data. Please note that currently the dashboard displays data up to April 9, 2022 as I currently must update the dataset manually.
